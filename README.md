# ADK LLM Framework Google

Welcome to the **ADK LLM Framework Google** project!

This repository is designed to provide a framework for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) using Google technologies. The primary language used in this project is Jupyter Notebook, making it accessible for experimentation, prototyping, and educational purposes.

## Project Overview

**ADK LLM Framework Google** aims to simplify the development, deployment, and experimentation of LLM-based solutions. It provides reusable components, example notebooks, and utilities to help users quickly get started with LLM workflows and integrate them with Google Cloud and open-source tools.

## Features

- Modular and extensible framework for LLM development
- Example Jupyter Notebooks for common LLM tasks
- Integrations and utilities for Google Cloud environments
- Open-source and easy to customize

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mynamerahulkumar/adkProjectUd.git
   cd adkProjectUd
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   - Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
   - (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   - Dependencies are typically listed in a `requirements.txt` or within the notebooks themselves.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Explore the notebooks:**
   - Open Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Browse and run the example notebooks to get started.
